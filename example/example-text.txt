To Mr. Benedict Crustworthy,  

I want you to  
try kombucha.  

That’s right, kombucha. Preferably one of those fruity ones.  

But that's not all. I’m writing to urge you to return the $10 billion
in monopoly money you "borrowed" during the Great Office Bake-Off
Scandal of 2022. You know the one: the cupcake debacle that left
Jerry from accounting emotionally scarred and half the office
wondering where all the sprinkles went.  

-> While you’re at it, maybe think about donating a portion of your
-> *questionably acquired* bake sale winnings to the “Frosting Futures
-> Fund” and the “Support for Sugary Survivors Society,” two
-> organizations dedicated to supporting those who were forced to endure
-> your sugar-fueled corporate shenanigans.  

~ Honestly, Benedict, your triple-decker fudge tower may have been
legendary, but the consequences were anything but sweet. Think about
~ the poor souls who had to eat Susan's flavorless zucchini muffins
after you cleaned out the bake sale table. Jerry still wakes up at
~ night mumbling, "It wasn’t even *real* frosting..."  

And don't even get me started on the gummy bear price surge that
followed. As a result, kids across the tri-state area were rationing
candy like it was 1942.

P.S. Seriously though, try the kombucha. It’s good for your soul.
