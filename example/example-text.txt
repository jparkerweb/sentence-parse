<p>To Mr. Benedict Crustworthy,</p>
<p>I want you to try kombucha.</p>
<p>That’s right, kombucha. Preferably one of those fruity ones.</p>
<p>But that's not all. I’m writing to urge you to return the $10 billion in monopoly money you "borrowed" during the Great Office Bake-Off Scandal of 2022. You know the one: the cupcake debacle that left Jerry from accounting emotionally scarred and half the office wondering where all the sprinkles went.</p>

<strong>$4,000,000</strong>
<p>&rarr; While you’re at it, maybe think about donating a portion of your <em>questionably acquired</em> bake sale winnings to the “Frosting Futures Fund” and the “Support for Sugary Survivors Society,” two organizations dedicated to supporting those who were forced to endure your sugar-fueled corporate shenanigans.</p>
<p><em>Honestly, Benedict, your triple-decker fudge tower may have been legendary, but the consequences were anything but sweet. Think about the poor souls who had to eat Susan's flavorless zucchini muffins after you cleaned out the bake sale table. Jerry still wakes up at night mumbling, "It wasn’t even <strong>real</strong> frosting..."</em></p>
<p>And don't even get me started on the gummy bear price surge that followed. As a result, kids across the tri-state area were rationing candy like it was 1942.</p>
<ul><li>one</li><li>two</li></ul>that was a list

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Seriously though, try the kombucha. It’s good for your soul.</p>
