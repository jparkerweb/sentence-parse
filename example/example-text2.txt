Some have the company being acquired -<br />by, among others, IBM, Lucent, Cisco, Sun and AT&amp;T - while<br />others see the company selling off its best technologies<br />(eDirectory and file caching) to separate companies.<br /><br />Neither of these will happen in the near future, the next six<br />to 12 months. The company is making money, although not a lot<br />of money, and it does have a significant amount of cash on hand<br />with little or no outstanding debt. <p>But because the stock price<br />is currently so low ($9 to $10 per share over the past few<br />months), sale of the company wouldn&#39;t bring in enough to<br />satisfy the stockholders.</p> And any company offering what Novell<br />stockholders want would be in trouble with its own<br />stockholders.<br /><br />Selling off technologies makes even less sense, since it would<br />leave Novell with more cash (which it doesn,t need) and fewer<br />products to sell.<br /><br />Instead, watch as new marketing and sales programs are launched<br />in the fall. These will either boost sales back to 1999 levels<br />or precipitate a wholesale turnover of top management, leading<br />to more rumors of a sellout. And those rumors might be true.<br /><br />To contact Dave Kearns:<br />-----------------------<br />Dave Kearns is the Word Wrangler for Virtual Quill, a writing<br />agency serving the computer and networking industries.
